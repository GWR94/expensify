#### Deployment
Heroku was used for this stage of deployment for the website, as it's free and can easily be upgraded should it become necessary to do so.

#### Database
The database that I used was Firebase as it offers a free option and is sufficient to fulfill all needs for the application. It also gave the option to link social media accounts as a login technique.

#### Tests
Test were made using Jest & enzyme.
