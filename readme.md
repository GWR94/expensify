# Blogify
This is the final version of the project created during the React Complete Web Development Course by Andrew Mead on Udemy.

#### Technologies Used
- React 16
- Redux
- React-Redux
- React-Router-Dom
- Babel
- SASS
- React-Dates
- Redux-Thunk
- Webpack
- React-Modal

#### Deployment
Heroku was used for this stage of deployment for the website, as it's free and can easily be upgraded should it become necessary to do so.

#### Database
The database that I used in the project was Firebase as it offers a free option that is sufficient to fulfill all needs for the application. It also gave the option to link social media accounts as a login technique, which was a feature that benefits the application as a whole.

#### Tests
Test were made using Jest & Enzyme.
